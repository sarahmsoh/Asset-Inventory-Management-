# Shulee Asset Inventory Management Admin Panel

## Overview

This project is a frontend-only admin panel for an Asset Inventory Management system designed to help organizations efficiently track, update, and manage their assets. Built using React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, and Bootstrap, the admin panel offers a comprehensive user interface that supports:

- User and asset management
- Role-based access control (Admin, Procurement Manager, Employee)
- Request handling for asset repairs and new asset requirements
- System configuration, audit logs, and reporting

The app is built with scalability in mind and adheres to best practices in modern web development. The admin interface is designed for demo purposes with simulated backend behavior and a hard-coded admin role.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Simple login simulation that authenticates users.
- **Role-Based Access**: Protected routes to ensure only authorized users (admins) can access specific sections.
- **Dashboard**: Overview of system metrics, key activity, and status updates.
- **User Management**: Create, update, and delete users; assign roles and permissions.
- **Asset Management**: Add and configure assets (with categories, departments, urgency levels, and image URLs).
- **Request Management**: View and manage user asset/repair requests.
- **Audit Logs**: Monitor user activities and system events.
- **System Configuration**: Configure asset categories, departments, urgency levels, and other system settings.
- **Reports & Analytics**: Generate reports to analyze asset usage, pending requests, and overall system performance.
- **Header Component**: Displays the company name ("shulee"), a centered search bar, and a logout button on the far right.
- **Primary & Secondary Sidebars**: Efficient navigation panels that adjust based on the active section.

## Technologies

- **React**: For building the UI.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling.

## Usage

- **Login:** Access the app by using the simulated login form. On successful login, the admin panel is displayed.
- **Navigation:** Use the Header's search bar and logout button, along with the primary and secondary sidebars, for seamless navigation across dashboard, users, assets, requests, audit logs, system configurations, and reports.
- **Forms:** Use the provided forms to add users and assets. The asset form includes fields for asset name, category, department, urgency, and an optional image URL.

## Future Improvements

- **Backend Integration:** Replace simulated API calls with real backend endpoints.
- **Enhanced Role Management:** Dynamically decode JWT tokens to manage roles.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Further refine the user interface and improve responsiveness.
- **Testing:** Increase unit and UI test coverage.
- **Accessibility:** Improve accessibility for all users.
